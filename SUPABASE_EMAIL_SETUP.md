- ✅ **Configure SMTP** for reliable delivery
- ✅ **Test email flows** thoroughly

## 🔧 **Current Authentication Status**

### **What's Working:**
- ✅ **User created in Supabase** - Account exists
- ✅ **Password stored securely** - Hashed and safe
- ✅ **Backend authentication** - Code is correct
- ✅ **Frontend ready** - Mock system removed

### **What Needs Setup:**
- ⚠️ **Email confirmation** - Either disable or confirm manually
